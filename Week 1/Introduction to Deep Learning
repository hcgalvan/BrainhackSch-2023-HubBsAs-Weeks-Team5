Consider these statements/questions and answer them briefly in a saved doc:

1. Give an example of a research question that you could use deep learning to solve.
Can we create a deep learning model to classify attentional states based on EEG data recorded during a visual task?

2. How would deep learning provide an advantage for solving the problem?
It would be useful because deep learning models can learn patterns and relationshps directly from the EEG data. 
We can use that information to train a large dataset of EEG recordings and the model would extract subtle and nonlinear features to distinguish between focused and distracted states. 

3. Give an example of a research question for which deep learning would not be appropriate.
What are the mechanisms involved in the consolidation of personal memories?

4. What would be a disadvantage of deep learning compared to another method?
It wouldn't be useful as its own because it will be able to recognize patterns but to answer that  we need a deeper understanding of biological and physiological processes involved.
We believe it will be perhaps more useful to use more experimental techniques or a combination of them.
